          Click on &quot;Get Inspired&quot; and get a key, popular chord
          progressions, and a tempo to start writing with. You can also click on
          the boxes to change them independently, but clicking on the key box
          will change the progressions also.

          Sometimes we need a little push to get into the creative zone. There
          is a near infinite amount of options when it comes to making any sort
          of art. That is both amazing and daunting. Amazing, because anybody
          can do anything, but daunting, because when you can do anything, where
          do you even start?
